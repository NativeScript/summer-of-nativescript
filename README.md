# Summer of NativeScript

**Run a meetup, get some NativeScript stickers!**

Summer is here and it's a great time to get excited about building apps NativeScript. Why this summer? Because **if you run a NativeScript meetup in July, August, or September and let us know about it, we'll send you a cool pack of NativeScript stickers!**

If you already belong to a meetup group, now's a great time to put a NativeScript meetup on the calendar. If you don't have a group, now's a great time to start one.

Don't know what to present? No worries, we have a set of pre-prepared resources you can choose from. Customizable slide decks? Check. Video recordings of those slides being presented? Check. Hands-on labs you can work through? Check. Everything is open source, freely available, and liberally licensedâ€”so you're free to use, copy, and alter to your heart's desire.

And the best part? We're providing *three* meetups worth of content so you can spend the whole summer with NativeScript. You can choose to run a single meetup to learn the basics, or run all three to dive deep into the NativeScript ecosystem. June's content is available now, and July's and August's are coming soon. Follow [@nativescript on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nativescript) for updates.
