# Summer of NativeScript

> By [TJ VanToll](http://tjvantoll.com) and [Clark Sell](http://csell.net/)

This repo contains the slides, videos, and hands-on labs for the [Summer of NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/summer). If you run into any problems with the labs, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/tjvantoll/summer-of-nativescript/issues/new).

> **Note**: **The labs in this repo are no longer maintained.** But don’t despair! The NativeScript team provides a far-more-comprehensive [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.nativescript.org/start/getting-started) for getting you up to speed with NativeScript. The guide is perfect for classrooms, workshops, and self-paced learning.

## Meetup #1: Welcome to NativeScript
