# Summer of NativeScript

**Run a meetup, get a NativeScript t-shirt and a pack of NativeScript stickers!**

This repo contains the slides, videos, and hands-on labs for the [Summer of NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/summer). If you run into any problems with the labs, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/tjvantoll/summer-of-nativescript/issues/new).
