# Summer of NativeScript: July Lab

There are two ways to use NativeScript: through its CLI or through Telerik AppBuilder. Even though NativeScript itself is the same regardless of the option you choose, the way you interace with NativeScript—how you run your app, how you change configuration files, and so forth—differs based on the interface you choose. Both options are summarized below.

## Option #1: NativeScript CLI

The [NativeScript CLI](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript-cli) lets you develop your apps locally and free of charge. However, you must setup your system with the necessary requirements to perform iOS and Android builds. For instance, you must have a Mac to build iOS apps with the NativeScript CLI.

## Option #2: Telerik AppBuilder

Telerik AppBuilder is a [paid product](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/appbuilder), but everyone gets a free 30-day trial to evaluate the product. Telerik AppBuilder is part of the [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform), which offers additional tools and services for NativeScript apps—including push notifications, cloud data, analytics, and more.
